# Mined_Hackathon-Document-structure-analysis-NLP
API build for model to identify the type of document and give a summarization along with the main keywords using NLP.

LayoutLM model can classify 16 diff types of documents:
</br>
'scientific_report', 'resume', 'memo', 'file_folder', 'specification', 'news_article', 'letter', 'form', 'budget', 'handwritten', 'email', 'invoice', 'presentation', 'scientific_publication', 'questionnaire', 'advertisement'.

RVL-CDIP Dataset contains 2500 docs images for each category.

Dataset can be downloaded from below link:

API built only for summarizer.
The accuracy for the LayoutLM odel in our case comes out to be 0.7 which is a pretty good measure.
